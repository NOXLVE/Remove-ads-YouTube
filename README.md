YouTube is one of the most popular video streaming platforms in the world, but it is also known for its many advertisements, which can interrupt the viewing experience.

## My script allows you to:

1. Elimination of Intrusive Video Ads
2. Removal of Banner and Pop-up Ads
3. Removing Ad Blocker Detection Message

## How to use it ?

To use it, simply activate the script (file: "Remove YouTube ads") via Tampermonkey.

Please note that the script may encounter some issues. For example, after removing the ad when launching a video, you may encounter a white or black screen. In this case, you will have to reload the 
page or press the "F" key on your keyboard to activate full screen mode. This problem being intermittent, it cannot be directly corrected by the script.
