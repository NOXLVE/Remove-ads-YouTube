YouTube is one of the most popular video streaming platforms in the world, but it is also known for its many advertisements, which can interrupt the viewing experience.

## My script allows you to:

1. Elimination of Intrusive Video Ads
2. Removal of Banner and Pop-up Ads
3. Removing Ad Blocker Detection Message

## How to use it ?

To use it, simply activate the script (file: "Remove YouTube ads") via Tampermonkey.

After testing on various browsers, only one presents a notable problem: Opera/Opera GX. It appears that ad blocking is not optimal, causing the video to disappear. You will likely need to refresh the page several times until it works correctly.
But to overcome this problem my script allows you to activate AdBlock (extension) to avoid this problem.

I am currently working on developing a specific script for this browser, which will be available soon. In the meantime, I recommend using another browser.

Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience caused.
